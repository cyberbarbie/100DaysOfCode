100DaysOfCyberSecurity

**Day 1 (01.01.23):** Happy new year! Today on TryHackMe I continued on the SOC analyst path and reviewed what I learned last week regarding the basics of threat modeling and network intrusion models.

I learned about MITRE and how it is a knowledge base that tracks Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) and their tactics, techniques, and procedures. This helps understand how attacks occur which helps both mitigate and prevent attacks occuring in your environment.

I explored the Diamond Model and cyber kill chain as well which are other models to understand the different phases an attacker goes through to execute an attack from reconnaissance (gathering research on the target) to actions on objective.

I also did some light review on Security+, specifically on the CIA triad and ways to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of your data.

**Day 2 (01.02.23):** Day 2! I started off by reviewing the SDLC, the different phases that are involved in the software development process from planning the design requirements to continuous integration and continous delivery. I then refined my notes on virtualization and set up an SSL certificate on AWS for my personal site, taeluralexis.com. I have little to no knowledge of AWS so I'm looking forward to hosting some projects on it! I also automated the process of setting up VMs using Vagrant. I'll most likely end the night with some more studying on the Security+.

**Day 3 (01.03.23):** Day 3...I reviewed alot of networking basics such as network devices, how OSI model and TCP/IP work, and how encapsulation and de-encapsulation work. I also finally learned a bit about Ethernet standards. I compiled all of my notes into a GitHub repository that I'll be actively maintaining and updating. I'll keep adding to it as I find more of my notes. That's all for today! Goodnight lol

**Day 4 (01.04.23):** I did a hands-on workshop on CrowdStrike, an endpoint security management tool that utilizes threat intelligence and AI to track APTs, automate the process of real-time response to threats and get a graphical view of your threat landscape in your organization.

**Day 5 (01.05.23):** Learned how to use GoPhish which is an open source phishing framework and launched a phishing attack. Later on I created and deployed a Jekyll blog and created a CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions. I'm so happy. One of my biggest goals was to relaunch my website and create more content! I'm migrating my old blog posts to the new site now and will update them. I'm also in the process of writing a blog post on how to create a CI/CD pipeline. I have so much excitement and optimism for the new year. This was a beautiful day! 

**Day 6 (01.06.23):** Today is a light day and I'm taking the weekend off but today I completed the intro to DevSecOps room on TryHackMe where I learned about software development models like Agile and Waterfall and their faults which led to the creation of DevOps, a philosophy that foster a culture centered on fostering relationships between different teams and automating processes. DevSecOps integrates security at every phase of the development lifecycle as opposed to viewing it as an afterthought. Common DevSecOps practices include educating teams, code analysis, and automation.
