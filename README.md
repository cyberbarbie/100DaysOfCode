# #100DaysOfCode

Hello world for the 1000th time :)

**Motivations:** I want to keep myself accountable by making a commitment to write a nightly summary of what I've learned or done that's related to tech. Learning doesn't stop when you've landed your first job in tech, it continues!

**Background:** I'm a front-end developer who has an interest in cybersecurity, especially web app pentesting. I've been learning security on sites like YouTube, TryHackMe, Portswigger, and a few books. 

2023 Goals:

✅ Re-launch blog site and host on AWS 

✅ Publish more technical content to help others get into tech

✅ Learn OWASP / Web Security Vulnerabilities

✅ Get a new job opportunity
