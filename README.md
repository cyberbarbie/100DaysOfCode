# 100 Days Of Code (2023 Edition)

I'm a front-end developer and my goal is to land an application security engineer or pentester role this year. How I plan to make that happen is by studying every day on TryHackMe going through the Jr Pentester path, exploring different tools (ie Bloodhound AD, BurpSuite, Nmap, etc), write and publish blog posts on different security vulnerabilities, HTB/THM writeups on my blog, and study for the Security+ certification.
