## Follow My Blog! ðŸ’Œ
I publish blog posts on common web security vulnerabilities and the latest cyber threats, THM/HTB writeups, coding, and helping people break into tech from non-traditional backgrounds. Subscribe to stay updated!  

Check out my post on how I transitioned from customer service to front-end developer [here](https://www.taeluralexis.com/jekyll/update/2019/12/16/how-i-landed-my-first-web-developer-role.html)

## If you've decided to join:

1.  Fork this repo and commit to the [Log](log-entries.md)
3.  **Code/Hack minimum an hour every day for the next 100 days.**
4.  **Encourage at least two other people in the challenge on Twitter every day! Pay it forward!**
5.  Delete the examples in the log, or comment them out, and start filling it with your own content.
6.  **Tweet your progress every day using the #100DaysOfCode hashtag.**
7.  Important: (see No.4 above for a specific rule on this) Encourage others who are doing the same challenge on Twitter or elsewhere - by giving them props when they are posting updates on their progress, supporting them when things get difficult. Thus we will grow a community that is helpful and effective, which will lead to a higher success rate for each person involved. It's also more likely that you will stick to your own commitment, given that you will get acquainted with a couple people (or more) right away.
8.  If you find a great, helpful resource that others would benefit from, either submit a Pull Request to add it to the repo, or just tweet at me (see info below)
