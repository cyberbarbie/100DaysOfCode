# I've joined the #100DaysOfDevSecOps Challenge
Inspired by [#100DaysOfCode](https://github.com/kallaway/100-days-of-code)

## Contents

* [Log - click here to see my progress](log-entries.md)
* [Resources](resources.md)

## Goals for Q1

- Build CI/CD Pipeline (Done with GitHub Actions)

- Publish 2 blog posts a month 

- Complete Jr Pentester path on TryHackMe 

- Finish Practical Ethical Hacking course by The Cyber Mentor 

## If you've decided to join:

1.  Fork this repo and commit to the [Log](log-entries.md)
3.  **Code/Hack minimum an hour every day for the next 100 days.**
4.  **Encourage at least two other people in the challenge on Twitter every day! Pay it forward!**
5.  Delete the examples in the log, or comment them out, and start filling it with your own content.
6.  **Tweet your progress every day using the #100DaysOfCode hashtag.**
7.  Important: (see No.4 above for a specific rule on this) Encourage others who are doing the same challenge on Twitter or elsewhere - by giving them props when they are posting updates on their progress, supporting them when things get difficult. Thus we will grow a community that is helpful and effective, which will lead to a higher success rate for each person involved. It's also more likely that you will stick to your own commitment, given that you will get acquainted with a couple people (or more) right away.
8.  If you find a great, helpful resource that others would benefit from, either submit a Pull Request to add it to the repo, or just tweet at me (see info below)
